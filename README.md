## The Challenge

"Currently GSA posts their public datasets on open.gsa.gov/data which are 
consumed and re-presented on data.gov. The presentation on open.gsa.gov is 
limited to the title, description and embedded url, and grouped by theme. 
We are looking for a new and fresh presentation of our public data listing 
which will enrich the user experience, enhance search capability, and allow 
easier viewing of additional metadata."

## Objective

One [principle](https://project-open-data.cio.gov/principles/) of the open 
source initiative is to help create machine readable data sets. This 
accessibility principle is critical to enabling data hungry algorithms to crunch 
complex data sets into meaningful value.

Our application, Machine Ready, leverages existing data.json content to determine 
how the datasets match up to the accessibility principles laid out by the open 
data initiative. The objective is to help agencies visualize which datasets could
benefit from a translation to more machine friendly formats.
